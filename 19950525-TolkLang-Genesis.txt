I've taken as a personal work the translation of verses from the Bible.
But i've no english version of the Bible, but in Spanish (I'm a native 
Spanish speaker), so I just intend to translate Quenya->English as an
approach.

Initially I've traslated the first 9 verses from Genesis 1. 
(this is just a try i'm just a computer scientist who has languages as a 
hobby...so, corrections are greately thanked)


Yestiesse Eru onte meneli ar arda. 

Ar arda ne ruukina ar lusta,

ar lumbuler ne amantesse undumeo.

Ar i-suule Ero nore atso amantesse i-linquion.

Ar Eru quente: i-kala e.a; ar kala e.ie

Ar Eru kene tana i-kala ne maara; ar Eru uusange kala ho lumbuler.

Ar Eru este i-kala ve arya, ar este i-lumbuler ve loo.

Ar minya duuna e.ie anaroore ar anaruuta.

Tare Eru quente: enyesse i-linquion na i-palya, 

ar linqui ho linqui nai uusanga

Ar Eru este i-palya ve meneli. Ar neuna duuna ne anaroore ar anarnuuta.


translated as:

In the beginning The One (God) created the heavens and the earth. 

And the earth was disordered and empty, 

and the shadows were over the face [ama-anta-esse over-face-in] of the abyss.

And the ghost of God [airesuule: Holy Ghost?] moved itself [atso: VK used
by A.Appleyard on his translation of the Annals of Valinor meaning itself, 
himself] over the face of the waters.

And God said: be the light (imperative). And the light was.

And God saw that the light was good; and God separed {uu-sange: un-gathered] 
the light from the darkness.

And God named the light as day, and named the darkness night.

And the first day was sunrise and sunset [anar-nuuta: sun-set < nuuta Q. set 
(from sun or moon) and using the model anar-oore] 

Then God said: be the expansion in the middle of the waters,

and separe the waters from the waters.

And God named the expansion as heavens. And the second day was, sunrise and 
sunset.





  Ok. that's what i've made ... feel free to flame me :)
