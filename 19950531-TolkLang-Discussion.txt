Do you mean to use vala as a verb? or make a word for vala-like creation?

I've no knowledge of hebrew (and just a bit of arabic) but I've a bible
with references and there are references between the 'skies' from genesis
and those of psalms 36.5, 102.25-27 (Hebrews 1.10) and 136.5. Besides, it's 
true that is plenty of 'skies' in my bible, but there is 'sky' too as
in Gen.7,23: "..., and the birds from the sky; and they were..." speaking 
about the destruction of the living beings on Noah's time.

ok. :)

I'll use "kumna ar lusta" for void and empty. (I thought in kuuma - kumna and
Chaos - chaos).

ok. that's true but I think on an elf reading in Quenya this translation, 
and what would he understand.

besides, there's no need of "atso"... I've no notice on reflexive pronouns
but... how about reflexive verbs??

I vote for kenne.

all right, just a suggestion.

_ter(e)-_ PREP through
_tereva_ A piercing, fine, acute
the root TER(ES) itself is the verb pierce.
so, I prefer un-gather till I find a word for separe (there's no need
of cutting or piercing or slashing to separe light from darkness).
maybe if translate poetically i'd use such words.

right, I repented after posting.

I've Sin. dana, Que. daana (maybe wrong) both from BoLT
the PE root ar-  :day
and the PE ari   :day
Que. are :day <--- I'll use it now.

about Lomendaanar I'd say it's Lomenda'n-ar with the "ar-" as suffix, usually
quenya uses "-re", but that's for special days of the year, the kind I'd
use for "christmas", "new year", etc. but there's "lemnar": 
   <lem(i)n-ar> Valian week (five days).

I do accept the argument... version 3 will use palyale. Anyways it's 
"the expansion", and "the heavens expansion, where the birds fly" of Gen.1,20

I was wrong... (that's for working without my notes) it should have been, 
at least, _enyasse_ (_en(d)ya-sse_ loc.sing. as cirya -> ciryasse) 

Now, from ETYM we have PE _ened-_ 'centre'
PE _ened-_ > Q. _ende_ middle, centre, core > _endesse_ 'in the middle'
