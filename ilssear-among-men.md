# **The Arrival of the Star-Silver Sea**

In the years after the fall of Gondolin, Ilssëar wandered eastward into lands untouched by the shadow of Morgoth but ripe with the struggles of newly-awakened Men. Among these mortal tribes, few had yet encountered the Eldar, and their lives were marked by hardship, fear, and conflict.

It was during a time of great need that Ilssëar appeared to them, emerging from the wilderness like a figure out of myth. The Men of the region, a hardy but fragmented people who called themselves the Vardain, saw him first as a solitary wanderer. Clad in simple garments, with his eyes reflecting the light of unseen stars, he introduced himself not as a lord or a warrior but as "one who seeks."

The Vardain quickly discovered that this quiet figure possessed gifts unlike any they had known. When their forges failed, he showed them how to mend their tools; when their fields faltered, he taught them the ways of the earth; when their leaders quarreled, he spoke with wisdom that stilled even the most fiery tempers.

## **Ilssëar, Leader of Men**

A famine struck the Vardain one bitter winter, threatening their survival. Rival clans, desperate for resources, turned on one another. Ilssëar, moved by their plight, refused to stand idle. Using his intuitive understanding of both nature and humanity, he devised a plan to distribute scarce food equitably. Yet it was not his strategy alone that quelled the chaos—it was his ability to speak to the hearts of the people.

His words, laced with empathy and the poetry of the stars, awakened something in the Vardain. He told them of **Eru**, the One who created all, and how the light of Eru lived in every being, mortal and immortal alike. Through his guidance, the clans united under a fragile peace, and Ilssëar was named **Tirionya**, *"Our Watcher,"* for they saw in him a guardian of not only their lives but their very souls.

## **The Transformation of His Name**

Among the Vardain, the Elvish name Ilssëar Andovaryo was both awe-inspiring and difficult for mortal tongues. Over time, it softened into **Ilssear Andovarien**:

- **Ilssear**: A simpler pronunciation of Ilssëar, retaining the essence of *"Star-Silver Sea."*
- **Andovarien**: A humanized form of Andovaryo, with *-ien* added as an honorific suffix in their tongue, suggesting not femininity but reverence and legacy. Among Men, it came to mean *"He of the Gate"* or *"Gatekeeper of Wisdom."*

## **The Light-Bringer’s Poetry**

Ilssëar’s leadership was marked not only by his technical ingenuity and wisdom but also by his mastery of the spoken word. His speeches and songs, composed in the mortal tongue but resonant with Elvish cadence, became treasures passed down among the Vardain.

One of the most beloved poems attributed to him is **"Aurië Yondëa"** (*The Gift of the Day*):  

> *“Beneath the vault of Eru’s light,*  
> *Each life a spark, though brief in flight.*  
> *The gate swings wide, the stars do gleam,*  
> *A fleeting life fulfills its dream.”*

This verse, though simple, captured his philosophy: that mortality, though brief, is a gift to be embraced with wonder and purpose.

## **The Ever-Seeking Among Mortals**

Ilssëar's insatiable curiosity—his gift for understanding all things—left a deep impression on the Vardain. They saw him not just as a wise leader but as one who embodied the yearning spirit of their own people. To them, he became a symbol of the eternal quest for knowledge, truth, and beauty.

It was said that, in his later years among them, Ilssëar began teaching the young not just how to craft tools or grow crops but how to seek the inner light within themselves. His lessons often began with a simple question: *"What lies beyond this gate?"*

## **His Legacy Among Men**

When Ilssëar finally departed, it was not by death but by choice. He is said to have walked into the western seas, leaving behind only his staff of silver and a final verse:

> *“When shadow falls and stars awaken,*  
> *Guard well the light, the gift unshaken.*  
> *For gates shall close, but one remains—*  
> *Your mind will open new domains.”*

His memory endured in the Vardain’s oral traditions, and his teachings shaped their culture for generations. His name, **Ilssear Andovarien**, became synonymous with enlightenment, compassion, and guardianship. To this day, the descendants of the Vardain recount tales of **The Ever-Seeking** and **The Light-Bringer**, who taught them not only to survive but to live with wonder and wisdom.
